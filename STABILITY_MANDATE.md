## Non-Negotiable Requirements

### For All Code Changes

1. **Must Pass**:
   - All linting and formatting checks
   - All automated tests
   - Security vulnerability scans
   - Code review by designated owner

2. **Must Have**:
   - Tests for new functionality
   - Updated documentation
   - CHANGELOG entry (for significant changes)
   - Clear commit messages

3. **Must Not**:
   - Introduce new security vulnerabilities

   - Break existing functionality
   - Bypass review processes

### For New Projects

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Approved architecture design
   - Security review completed
   - Resource allocation confirmed
   - Success metrics defined

2. **Standards Compliance**:
   - CI/CD pipeline configured
   - Documentation template completed
   - Test framework in place
   - Security scanning enabled

3. **Governance**:
   - Code owners assigned
   - Review process defined
   - Monitoring configured
   - Runbooks created

### For Production Deployments

1. **Required Checks**:
   - All CI/CD checks pass
   - Security scan clean
   - Performance benchmarks met
   - Rollback plan documented

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Automated Enforcement

- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires passing checks and reviews
- **Status Checks**: Required CI/CD checks must pass
- **Security Gates**: High/critical vulnerabilities block merge
- **Coverage Gates**: Test coverage must not decrease
- **Dependency Scanning**: All dependencies must be approved

### Manual Enforcement

- **Code Review**: Tiger Team members have final authority
- **Deployment Blocking**: Tiger Team can block unsafe deployments
- **Task Closure**: Stale work is closed after warning period
- **Repository Archive**: Unmaintained repos are archived
- **Access Revocation**: Non-compliant practices result in reduced access

### Progressive Discipline
